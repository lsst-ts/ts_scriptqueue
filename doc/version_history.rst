Version History

v2.8.1
======

Changes:

* Removed a small bit of ts_salobj 5 compatibility code.
* Add a conda Jenkins build.

Requirements:

* ts_idl 2
* ts_salobj 6.1
* ts_xml 6.1 (older versions might work but have not been tested)
* IDL files for Test, Script, and LOVE generated by ts_sal 5
* SALPY_Test generated by ts_sal 5 or later

v2.8.0
======

Changes:

* Update for ts_salobj 6.1, which is required.
* Add support for the ``--state`` command-line argument in ``run_script_queue.py``.
  This requires ts_salobj 6.1.
* Add ``initial_state`` constructor argument to `ScriptQueue`.
* Use `lsst.ts.salobj.set_random_lsst_dds_partition_prefix` instead of `lsst.ts.salobj.set_random_lsst_dds_domain`.
  This requires ts_salobj 6.
* Update ``Jenkinsfile`` to use Docker image ``lsstts/develop-env:develop`` instead of ``lsstts/salobj:develop``.
  This allows tests to use the ts_standardscripts and ts_externalscripts packages.
* Update to use ``pre-commit`` to maintain ``flake8`` and ``black`` compliance.

Requirements:

* ts_idl 2
* ts_salobj 6.1
* ts_xml 6.1 (older versions might work but have not been tested)
* IDL files for Test, Script, and LOVE generated by ts_sal 5
* SALPY_Test generated by ts_sal 5 or later

v2.7.2
======

Changes:

* Stop setting ``tel_max_history`` when creating `lsst.ts.salobj.Remote`\ s.
  I recommend not running this version with ts_salobj 5; it may work, but is risky.

Requirements:

* ts_salobj 6
* ts_idl 2
* ts_xml 4.7
* IDL files for Script and ScriptQueue, e.g. built with ``make_idl_files.py``
* asynctest

======

Changes:

* Enhance the ScriptQueue commander by adding a heartbeat monitor for the currently running script.

Requirements:

* ts_idl 1 / 2
* ts_xml 4.7
* IDL files for Script and ScriptQueue, e.g. built with ``make_idl_files.py``
* asynctest

v2.7.0
======

Changes:

* Overhaul the documentation.
* Add all finished scripts to the history, even if they failed.

v2.6.3
======

Changes:

* Enhance the ScriptQueue commander to add options for the "add" command
  and to accept a default log level for scripts as a command-line argument.

Requirements:

* ts_salobj 5.17
* ts_idl 1
* ts_xml 4.7
* IDL files for Script and ScriptQueue, e.g. built with ``make_idl_files.py``
* asynctest

v2.6.2
======

Changes:

* Fix the stopScripts command in `ScriptQueueCommander`.
* Update the pre-commit hook to block the commit if any code is not formatted with black.
* Update SConstruct so it does not need configuration and remove cfg file from ups.

Requirements:

* ts_salobj 5.17
* ts_idl 1
* ts_xml 4.7
* IDL files for Script and ScriptQueue, e.g. built with ``make_idl_files.py``
* asynctest

v2.6.1
======

Salobj 6 changed the name of the ``SalInfo.makeAckCmd`` method to ``SalInfo.make_ackcmd``.
Add a check to make sure ``SalInfo`` has a ``make_ackcmd`` attribute and use ``makeAckCmd`` if not.

Changes:

* Add backward compatibility between salobj 5 and 6.
* Add Jenkinsfile for CI job.
* In test_utils.py separate testing ``get_scripts_dir`` from standard and external scripts.
  Since packages are optional, skip tests if packages cannot be imported.

v2.6.0
======

Changes:

* Replaced ``bin/request_script.py`` with ``bin/command_script_queue.py``, which is based on `lsst.ts.salobj.CscCommander`.
  This change requires ts_sal v5.17.0 or later.

Requirements:

* ts_salobj 5.17
* ts_idl 1
* ts_xml 4.7
* IDL files for Script and ScriptQueue, e.g. built with ``make_idl_files.py``

  This requires ts_salobj 5.11 or later.

* Make time limits in unit tests simpler and more generous.
  This makes the tests simpler and should help tests pass on machines with limited resources.
* Fix flake8 warnings about f strings with no {}.
* Update ``.travis.yml`` to remove ``sudo: false`` to github travis checks pass once again.

Requirements:

* ts_salobj 5.11
